Thank you for looking through my code!

I have included a couple of things to show my skill sets.

1) html samples/index.html
	Technologies Used:  Bootstrap, AngularJS, html

	This is showing the homepage for my epeharda.com website.  I included it to show all of the dependancies that I used on the site as well as how I incorporated bootstrap styling.

2) html samples/contact.html
	Technologies Used:  AngularJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (calling this upon validation)

	I wanted to include the html file that calls some back end javascript samples I have provided for email
	validation.  Please see the "controller.js" file to view what happens when a user submits a valid contact
	form!
